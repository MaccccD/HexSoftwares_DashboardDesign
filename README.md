Project Brief:

For this project, I was tasked with creating a dashboard that effectively displays data, allows user interaction, and provides meaningful insights. 
The primary focus was demonstrating a solid understanding of data visualization principles while ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.

My Approach:

Building on my design approach from a previous project—where I created a landing page for a music store—I decided to align this dashboard with the same theme. 
The visualizations in this project are aimed at providing visitors to the store’s page with valuable information about the products sold. 
This includes insights into sales trends, customer behaviour, and profitability, giving users a comprehensive view of the store’s performance.
The visualizations are specifically designed to educate users about:

-Sales Performance: Highlighting top-selling products and trends over time.

-Profitability: Showcasing revenue and profit margins from the most popular products.

-Customer Insights & Engagement: Providing details on customer demographics and purchasing habits.

-Customer Satisfaction: Measuring satisfaction levels and identifying areas for improvement.
 
By focusing on these Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), the dashboard delivers actionable insights and enhances user understanding of the store's operations.
